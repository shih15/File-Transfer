The most famous such equation of state is the **ideal gas law**
$$
p=\rho RT
$$
It relate the pressure to the density and the temperature through the *specific gas constant* $R$. Another equation of state for ideal gases expresses the pressure as a function of the density and the entropy
$$
\frac{p}{p_0}=\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}e^{(s-s_0)/c_V}
$$
